This lab required us to use an ADC pin object to measure voltage as ADC values from an RC Circut with a time constant of about .3 seconds. With the lab 4 code we were able to plot the ADC responce to get the actual time constant and its error. See images below.

__Figure 2:__ Annotated RC Responce, (Tau Measured = .11s, %error = 63%).

The difference was outside of the 5%-25% range for error for typical electronic components. This may be due to a small resistance in our circut.
